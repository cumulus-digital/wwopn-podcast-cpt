# WWOPN Podcast Custom Post Type

This Wordpress plugin creates a new custom post type, Podcast, along with a new Genre taxonomy, a UI for creating a Big Feature of Podcasts, and featured Podcasts for each Genre.

Shortcodes are provided for outputting the features:

Big Feature: [podcasts-big]
Genre Feature: [podcasts-genre genre_id="3"]

## Options

By default, this plugin disabled comments and removes both the Posts and Comments sections from the admin UI.  To re-enable the admin UI, see the Podcast CPT options under Settings.
